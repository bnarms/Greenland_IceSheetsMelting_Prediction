# Greenland_IceSheetsMelting_Prediction

**Project Description:**  

Global warming is affecting our environment at an ever-increasing rate. It is essential to study climate change in Greenland as it has already crossed the point of no return because of its proximity to human civilization. Greenland cannot replenish the amount of ice loss, and sooner or later, the island will be ice free. Greenland ice sheet has the second-largest ice deposits on land just after Antarctica ice sheet. Therefore, understandings developed here could help us tackle the climate change in Antarctica. In this study, we are trying to apply machine learning algorithms to understand the underlying correlations between global warming's cause and effects. Our approach is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict the Greenland ice mass loss as a function of global average atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, global average atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration, global average atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration, global mean sea level, global average surface temperature, and human population. The idea was to develop a statistical model to predict Greenland ice sheet melting from the year 2021 until the year 2100 based on data from the year 1850 to the year 2020. Linear regression, Polynomial regression, and Polynomial regression using gradient descent were the three different regression-based machine learning algorithms used for data generation. A dataset containing original data points and artificially generated data points were compiled, which then served as the basis for developing final machine learning models. These regression-based machine learning models' performances were then evaluated based on their r-squared scores, training and validation losses and was then compared against each other for cross-checking the predictions. We observed that the linear regression model and the polynomial regression model using gradient descent performed very similarly and followed the expected trends, while the simple polynomial regression model performed poorly. Further observations were made about the repercussions that were postured by the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.
